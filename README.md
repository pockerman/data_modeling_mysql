# data_model_mysql

Simple data modeling example with MySQL. This repository models user activity data for a music streaming app called Sparkify. The idea of the project is taken from Udacity <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027">Data Engineering Nanodegree</a>. The data is modeled and persisted using the MySQL database. The database schema is shown further below. 
The pipeline is started by calling 

```
python etl.py --config

``` 

The script, creates a database called ```sparkifydb``` it then cleans the data and loads it into the corresponding tables. Note that on each execution of the script, it 
will attempt to drop the database if it exists. The database schema is outline below.
